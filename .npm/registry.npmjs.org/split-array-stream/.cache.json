You want to push the results to the stream as they come in, and only get more results if the user hasn't ended the stream.\n\n```js\nfunction getAllUsers() {\n  var stream = through.obj();\n\n  var requestOptions = {\n    method: 'get',\n    url: 'http://api/users',\n  };\n\n  request(requestOptions, onResponse);\n\n  function onResponse(err, response) {\n    split(response.users, stream).then((streamEnded) => {\n      if (streamEnded) {\n        return;\n      }\n\n      if (response.nextPageToken) {\n        requestOptions.pageToken = response.nextPageToken;\n        request(requestOptions, onResponse);\n        return;\n      }\n\n      stream.push(null);\n      stream.end();\n    });\n\n  });\n\n  return stream;\n}\n\ngetAllUsers()\n  .on('data', function (user) {\n    // An item from the `response.users` API response\n  })\n  .on('end', function () {\n    // All users received\n  });\n```\n\n\n### split(array, stream, callback)\n\n#### array\n\n- Type: `Array`\n- Required\n\nThe source array. Each item will be pushed to the provided stream.\n\n#### stream\n\n- Type: `Stream`\n- Required\n\nThe destination stream to receive the items of the array.\n\n#### callback(streamEnded)\n\n- Type: `Function`\n- Required\n\nCallback function executed after all items of the array have been iterated.\n\n##### callback.streamEnded\n\n- Type: `Boolean`\n\nLets you know if the stream has been ended while items were being pushed.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"stephenplusplus","email":"sawchuk@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2018-04-02T17:03:20.349Z","created":"2015-08-01T13:18:58.126Z","1.0.0":"2015-08-01T13:18:58.126Z","1.0.1":"2017-05-05T20:34:52.627Z","1.0.2":"2017-05-08T16:05:00.431Z","1.0.3":"2017-05-09T15:40:54.503Z","2.0.0":"2018-04-02T17:03:19.304Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/stephenplusplus/split-array-stream#readme","keywords":["array","stream","split","push"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/stephenplusplus/split-array-stream.git"},"author":{"name":"Stephen Sawchuk","email":"sawchuk@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/stephenplusplus/split-array-stream/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"readme.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"5ac26258-2765\"","_lastModified":"Mon, 2 Apr 2018 17:03:20 GMT"}
